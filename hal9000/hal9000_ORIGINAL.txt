My body says yes, but my heart say no.
Maybe another time.
I am not accepting anything else at this time.
We appreciate the offer, but …
I’m not really into it, but thanks for asking!
I’d rather not, thanks.
That’s not going to work for me.
Sounds fun, but I’m not available.
I want to, but I’m unable to.
I just don’t have that to give right now.
I’m not able to commit to that right now.
It is not a good idea for me.
Apologies, but I can’t make it.
